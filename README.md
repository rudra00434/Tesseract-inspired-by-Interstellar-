# Tesseract-inspired-by-Interstellar-
A 4D Hypercube representing Space time
# 🌌 Rotating Tesseract (4D to 3D Projection)

A Python visualization of a **tesseract** — the 4-dimensional analogue of a cube — rotating through multiple 4D planes and projected into 3D space.

Inspired by the **multi-dimensional concepts** shown in *Interstellar*, this project blends mathematics, physics, and cinematic visualization into a single animation.

## 📖 What is a Tesseract?
A **tesseract** (also called a hypercube) is a 4-dimensional cube.  
- In **1D**: a line segment has 2 vertices.  
- In **2D**: a square has 4 vertices.  
- In **3D**: a cube has 8 vertices.  
- In **4D**: a tesseract has **16 vertices**.

Just as a 3D object casts a 2D shadow, a 4D object can be *projected* into 3D space.  
This animation shows that projection while applying multiple 4D rotations.

- 4D rotation in multiple planes (`XY`, `ZW`, `XW`, `YZ`)
- Perspective projection from 4D → 3D
- Smooth cinematic animation
- Customizable colors, rotation speeds, and background
- Output to GIF or MP4

🎥 Inspiration

This project draws inspiration from the Tesseract Scene in Interstellar (2014), where time and space intersect in higher dimensions.
“To perceive beyond our three dimensions is to step into the realm of the impossible — until mathematics shows us the way.”

<h1>📚 Mathematics & Physics</h1>

Vertices: All points with coordinates (±1, ±1, ±1, ±1) in 4D space.
Edges: Pairs of vertices differing by exactly one coordinate.
Rotation: Applied via 4×4 rotation matrices in different 2D planes of 4D space.
Projection: Perspective transformation from 4D to 3D.
