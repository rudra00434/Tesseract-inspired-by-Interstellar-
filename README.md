# Tesseract-inspired-by-Interstellar-
A 4D Hypercube representing Space time
# ðŸŒŒ Rotating Tesseract (4D to 3D Projection)

A Python visualization of a **tesseract** â€” the 4-dimensional analogue of a cube â€” rotating through multiple 4D planes and projected into 3D space.

Inspired by the **multi-dimensional concepts** shown in *Interstellar*, this project blends mathematics, physics, and cinematic visualization into a single animation.

## ðŸ“– What is a Tesseract?
A **tesseract** (also called a hypercube) is a 4-dimensional cube.  
- In **1D**: a line segment has 2 vertices.  
- In **2D**: a square has 4 vertices.  
- In **3D**: a cube has 8 vertices.  
- In **4D**: a tesseract has **16 vertices**.

Just as a 3D object casts a 2D shadow, a 4D object can be *projected* into 3D space.  
This animation shows that projection while applying multiple 4D rotations.
